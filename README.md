# Altmetric-Score-Analysis

**Themes**: Altmetric Attention Score (AAS),Topic Research, Data Documentation, Association Rules, Regression, Clustering, Decision Tree, Factor Analysis and PCA

### Project Summary

This project provides an example of one of the first reports that I was apart, which is available for viewing in the two pdfs attached (Part1 and 2 Altmetric Analysis). I worked with two other members, Paul and Stephen. They taught me a lot about having a professional layout within reports and teamwork management. To this day I still use the report layout that I learnt from Stephen. 

In this project, we are tasked with finding out factors that have an influence on Altmetric Score. A topic research is first carried out to determine potential sources as well as identifying a list of cross referential literature that we can use to cross check results. Data documentation and sharing of research between each member was vital to ensure that any changes to the data was understood and could be standardized later on. Exploratory data analysis was first done individually to identify potential key factors which are used to create a standardized dataset that was then shared across all members to perform any statistical analysis of their choosing.

### Results

It is found that the dataset given is highly biased towards literature with high AAS and our research was limited due to a range of variable discrepancies across multiple years that the AAS was recorded. However, it was possible to see that AAS is greatly impacted by social media (Twitter and Facebook) and has a favourability to be higher with open access publications and specific publication fields (such as medical science). Journal impact variables and traditional publication "success" metrics were found to not be greatly correlated with AAS.

Thus, it is recommended that:

* To only use the AAS as a measure for the social attention that a paper attracts.  
* To focus on selected subjects if promoting publications via social media.
* To focus on open-access avenues for the distribution of papers.
* To benchmark actual AAS outcomes against predicted outcomes.


### Structure and Procedures

 1. Altmetric topic research 
 
    * Each member delved into reading about what Altmetric Score is and created a mind map to understand the connections between known factors that has an influence.  
    
 2. Data documentation, preparation and exploratory analysis
     
     * As the data was very messy and within multiple documents. Each member had to carefully document changes they performed on the data for exploratory analysis. To reduce analysis effort, only variables that are linked to known factors in the mind map were investigated and used later on to create a standardized dataset. It was also important to note any bias or completeness within the data we were using.
     
 3. Analysis with statistical techniques
 
     * To confirm exploratory analysis and topic research results, each member chooses their own statistical techniques to verify previous findings. These findings were then written up in a report detailing potential business/institutional implications.
